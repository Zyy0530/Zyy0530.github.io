Welcome to my academic homepage! I am Wesley Wang (王子悦), an incoming PhD student at the University of Sydney with a strong background in computer science and cybersecurity research.

## Academic Background

**University of Sydney** (2024 - Present)  
PhD in Computer Science - *Incoming*

**Nanjing University** (2018 - 2024)  
Master of Science & Bachelor of Science

## Research Interests

My research focuses on three interconnected areas at the forefront of cybersecurity:

### 🔒 Blockchain & Smart Contract Security
I investigate security vulnerabilities in blockchain systems and smart contracts, developing novel detection methods and mitigation strategies to enhance the security of decentralized applications and financial systems. This work is crucial as blockchain technology becomes increasingly prevalent in various industries.

### 🐛 Vulnerability Detection & Verification  
I advance automated vulnerability discovery techniques and formal verification methods for secure software development. My goal is to create more robust and reliable security assessment tools that can proactively identify potential security threats before they can be exploited.

### 🤖 LLM for Security
I leverage large language model agents for automated vulnerability discovery and verification in security-critical systems. This emerging field explores how AI can revolutionize cybersecurity practices and enhance our ability to identify, analyze, and address security threats at scale.
